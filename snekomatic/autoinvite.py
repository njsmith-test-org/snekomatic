# Maybe:
# send message on first PR, with basic background info â€“ volunteer project,
# super appreciate their contribution, also means we're sometimes slow.
# how to ping?
#
# send message with invitation giving info
#
# after they accept, post a closed issue to welcome them, and invite them to
# ask any questions and introduce themselves there? and also highlight it in
# the chat? (include link to search for their contributions, as part of the
# introduction?)
#
# in the future would be nice if bot could do some pings, both ways
#
# include some specific suggestions on how to get help? assign a mentor from a
# list of volunteers?
#
# I almost wonder if it would be better to give membership on like, the 3rd
# merged PR
# with the bot keeping track, and posting an encouraging countdown on each
# merged PR, so it feels more like an incremental process, where you can see
# the milestone coming and then when you get there it *is* a milestone.

    Hey @{username}, it looks like that was the first time we merged one of
    your PRs! Thanks so much! :tada: :birthday:

    If you want to keep contributing, we'd love to have you. So, I just sent
    you an invitation to join the python-trio organization on Github! If you
    accept, then here's what will happen:

    * Github will automatically subscribe you to notifications on all our
      repositories. (But you can unsubscribe again if you don't want the
      spam.)

    * You'll be able to help us manage issues (add labels, close them, etc.)

    * You'll be able to review and merge other people's pull requests

    * You'll get a [member] badge next to your name when participating in the
      Trio repos, and you'll have the option of adding your name to our
      [member's page](https://github.com/orgs/python-trio/people) and putting
      our icon on your Github profile
      ([details](https://help.github.com/en/articles/publicizing-or-hiding-organization-membership))

    If you want to read more, [here's the relevant section in our contributing
    guide](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#joining-the-team).

    Alternatively, you're free to decline or ignore the invitation. You'll
    still be able to contribute as much or as little as you like, and I won't
    hassle you about joining again. But if you ever change your mind, just let
    us know and we'll send another invitation. We'd love to have you, but more
    importantly we want you to do whatever's best for you.

    If you have any questions, well... I am just a [humble Python
    script](https://github.com/python-trio/snekomatic), so I probably can't
    help. But please do post a comment here, or [in our
    chat](https://gitter.im/python-trio/general), or [on our
    forum](https://trio.discourse.group/c/help-and-advice), whatever's
    easiest, and someone will help you out!
